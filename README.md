# House-Prices-Project

Here is the Analyses of King County House Prices I worked on in a group during the Linear Modeling class at UVA duing the Fall 2024 semester. Please Enjoy!!

Our task was to take the housing data from King County, Washington (Seatle and surrounding) and clean it up for use. We then used it topredict the cost of a house based on the house's information. We used linear regression techniques to do this, deciding which variables to include to gain the best metrics. We also used a logistic regression analysis to during whether a home was a quality home or not.
